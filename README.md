# Chess: Revitalized

## About:
An attempt at creating a spiritual successor to Chess. Built on the traditional game, innovation comes in the form of new pieces, unrestricted piece starting locations, and piece drafting system allowing for duplicate pieces (e.g. 2+ Queens per player)

## Features: 

### Piece drafting system:
Only rule is that you must have a King. Piece duplicates are permitted & starting locations are up to each player.

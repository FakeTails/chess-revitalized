# Chess: Revitalized

This project is a spiritual successor to the original board game of Chess dating back to the 6th-century, 
so while this game is from a century old design that has been repeated constantly throughout that time we took a new approach which we have named “Chess: Revitalized”. 
Our goal is to create a game that brings new life to the traditional system that players know and love by introducing brand new concepts such as new pieces, a unique placement of new and old pieces, 
a draft in which to place these pieces in a strategic way, and a points system for statistics tracking and unlocking of said new pieces
